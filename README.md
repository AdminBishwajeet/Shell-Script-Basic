Now i am working on bundle of commands..
A shell script is a computer program designed to be run by the Unix shell, a command-line interpreter.The various dialects of shell scripts are considered to be scripting languages. Typical operations performed by shell scripts include file manipulation, program execution, and printing text. A script which sets up the environment, runs the program, and does any necessary cleanup, logging, etc. is called a wrapper.
